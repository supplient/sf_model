        assuming there is only one pedestrian
        and using the empty map
        (so here should only have desire force)
    Start using the basic map
        assuming no social force
        (means add the wall's physical repulsive force)
    Add social_force for the wall
    Add multiple pedstrians
        (means add the pedstrians' physical repulsive force and social force)
