class Experiment
    one experiment's abstraction

    attribute--
        time: the abstract time in one experiment
        map: the map info. containing both the wall info and target area

    method--
        init(map)
        tick(pedestrians, time_tick)
            [IN] pedestrians: pedestrians' positions and velocities
                 time_tick: how much time to pass in this tick
            [OUT] pedestrians' positions and velocities after time_tick passed


class Pedestrian
    one pedestrian's abstraction

    property--
        weight
        radius
    
    attribute--
        position
        velocity


class PathSolver
    path finding algorithm's abstraction

    method--
        init(map)
        solve(from, to)
            [IN] from: ONE position as the path's start
                 to: MULTIPLE positions as the path's possible end
            [OUT] If exists one path, return the path (may with 0 length, if from is in to)
                  Otherwise, return None
        

class Config
    the config's set
