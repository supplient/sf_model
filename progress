    Build map input process
    Make a basic map and an empty map
    Build PathSolver
    Build pedstrian and target_area input process
    Build pedstrians' output process
    Build Experiment and Pedstrian 
        assuming there is only one pedestrian
        and using the empty map
        (so here should only have desire force)
    Start using the basic map
        assuming no social force
        (means add the wall's physical repulsive force)
    Add social_force for the wall
    Add multiple pedstrians
        (means add the pedstrians' physical repulsive force and social force)
    Build the json interface
